abstract: State of the art audio source separation models rely on supervised
  data-driven approaches, which can be expensive in terms of labeling resources.
  On the other hand, approaches for training these models without any direct
  supervision are typically high-demanding in terms of memory and time
  requirements, and remain impractical to be used at inference time. We aim to
  tackle these limitations by proposing a simple yet effective unsupervised
  separation algorithm, which operates directly on a latent representation of
  time-domain signals. Our algorithm relies on deep Bayesian priors in the form
  of pre-trained autoregressive networks to model the probability distributions
  of each source. We leverage the low cardinality of the discrete latent space,
  trained with a novel loss term imposing a precise arithmetic structure on it,
  to perform exact Bayesian inference without relying on an approximation
  strategy. We validate our approach on the Slakh dataset demonstrating results
  in line with state of the art supervised approaches while requiring fewer
  resources with respect to other unsupervised methods.
