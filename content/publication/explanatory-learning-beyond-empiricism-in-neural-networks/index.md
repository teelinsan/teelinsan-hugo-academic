abstract: We introduce Explanatory Learning (EL), a framework to let machines
  use existing knowledge buried in symbolic sequences -- e.g. explanations
  written in hieroglyphic -- by autonomously learning to interpret them. In EL,
  the burden of interpreting symbols is not left to humans or rigid human-coded
  compilers, as done in Program Synthesis. Rather, EL calls for a learned
  interpreter, built upon a limited collection of symbolic sequences paired with
  observations of several phenomena. This interpreter can be used to make
  predictions on a novel phenomenon given its explanation, and even to find that
  explanation using only a handful of observations, like human scientists do. We
  formulate the EL problem as a simple binary classification task, so that
  common end-to-end approaches aligned with the dominant empiricist view of
  machine learning could, in principle, solve it. To these models, we oppose
  Critical Rationalist Networks (CRNs), which instead embrace a rationalist view
  on the acquisition of knowledge. CRNs express several desired properties by
  construction, they are truly explainable, can adjust their processing at
  test-time for harder inferences, and can offer strong confidence guarantees on
  their predictions. As a final contribution, we introduce Odeen, a basic EL
  environment that simulates a small flatland-style universe full of phenomena
  to explain. Using Odeen as a testbed, we show how CRNs outperform empiricist
  end-to-end approaches of similar size and architecture (Transformers) in
  discovering explanations for novel phenomena.
